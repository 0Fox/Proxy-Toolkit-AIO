# Proxy Scanner and Scraper

A program that:
 - Scans proxies determining their performance (latency), type (HTTP or SOCKS), anonymity level (L1-L3 : Transparent - High - Elite)
 - Scrapes proxies off a given URL list
 - Harvests URLs using the BING search engine based on date (optional) for the most recent proxies

# Proxy Scanner and Scraper

A program that:
 - Scans proxies determining their performance (latency), type (HTTP or SOCKS), anonymity level (L1-L3)
 - Scrapes proxies off a given URL list
 - Harvests URLs using the BING search engine based on date (optional) for the most recent proxies

# July, 19th Update
Seems like the first proxy judge 'http://proxyjudge.info/azenv.php' is flagging 99% of good proxies as 'bad', would recommend using other proxy judges by selecting a different one from the dropdown-list/combo-list in the Scanner tab. I do not now if this issue was just a one off (happened today only) but you should always test a small list with 2-3 judges to check out if a particular proxy judge is erroneous.
